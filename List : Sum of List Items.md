## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

```
items=[153,147,124,102]
print(sum(items))
```
## Output
![438599597-60f189bf-1e7b-44c6-9015-ebc4537359fe](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d53ed196-1d96-465f-a5fa-ee01e82c24e3)

## Result
Thus, the python program was executed successfully
